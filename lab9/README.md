## Lab 9
- For the purpose of the lab, I have taken the working of library book issue system, where different types of penalty fees can be charged for a issued book. 
- In this example I have implemented the solution to this problem with a strategy pattern. 
- Penalties can be of following types: 
    - Late fees
    - Book damage fees
    - Book lost fees
- The fees is charged based on the price of the book.
- The Normal folder has the straightforward implementation of strategy pattern.
- The Lambda folder has the implementation with lambda functions.

# Advantages of using Lambda functions
- The code is more concise. The number of files are reduced from 5 to 2.
- The code is more readable, as the code for all the strategies is visible at the same time.
